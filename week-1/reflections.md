# 1.1 Think About Time

Some of the time and productivity ideas that I have learned about is the time box method, meditation, creating habits, thinking small and having a growth mindset. Each of these methods will help contribute to productivity: time box to help reflect on your work in intervals, meditation to reduce your beta waves, focusing on the smaller picture than big and allowing failure.

Time boxing is a time management process where you set an interval time limit that when reached you stop and reflect on your work up to that
point. A good time to use this method is during problem sets where you stop and review the work with your pair and plan the next steps.

Currently I don't have the best time management skills I am spontaneous and barley plan into the future. I do take breaks but not in any set time frame; so I could work for 2 hours straight and maybe take a 15 minute break. This strategy could be better but I first need to slowly get into a habit of trying alternative time management methods.

The ideas I want to incorporate is to get into habit of meditating for at least 5 minutes a day; I have already found an app for my phone on this.The other idea I want to start using is the time box method which I can incorporate by setting a timer that will signal when I need to stop and reflect. Eventually, I expect this to method to become a habit and I won't need the timer.

My overall plan for time management in phase 0 is to have a few trial sessions using the different methods and consolidating the ones that works for me. To continue to grow and become more productive I will need to research new ideas to try and learn from the failed attempts.


# 1.2 The Command Line

The shell is a command line based interpreter that provides communication with the operating system. The bash is one type of shell used to communicate with the Unix OS.

The one challenge I had going through the material was getting the grep command to work during the example in the Command Line Crash Course. I researched online but did not find the solution so I have marked it to come back to. I also had a little trouble with using cat command to write to a file and then closing it as the CTRL-d escape did not work but later found for me it was pressing CTRL+d.

I was able to use all the commands, even the grep but the example that was shown for grep did not work.

The most important commands I would have to say for the beginner like me would be the navigation command pwd, ls,  and cd. Navigating to get to where you want to go and searching for the files you are seeking is important because you cannot use the other commands without first finding the files you need.

pwd - process work directory - shows you the current file path to the work directory you are in

ls - list - this list all the files

mv - move or rename a file - this will move a file or rename it

cd - change directory - this will change which directory you are in

../ - previous directory - I believe this one goes to the previous directory

touch - create a file - this will create a new empty file

mkdir - make directory - will make a new directory

less - display file - this will parse and display the file in increments and allow you to scroll up and down

rmdir - remove directory - this will remove a directory

rm - remove - this is used to remove files

help - help - I think this one will pull up help manual - just tested this and wow its a built in cheat-sheet!
