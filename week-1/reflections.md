# 1.1 Think About Time

Some of the time and productivity ideas that I have learned about is the time box method, meditation, creating habits, thinking small and having a growth mindset. Each of these methods will help contribute to productivity: time box to help reflect on your work in intervals, meditation to reduce your beta waves, focusing on the smaller picture than big and allowing failure.

Time boxing is a time management process where you set an interval time limit that when reached you stop and reflect on your work up to that
point. A good time to use this method is during problem sets where you stop and review the work with your pair and plan the next steps.

Currently I don't have the best time management skills I am spontaneous and barley plan into the future. I do take breaks but not in any set time frame; so I could work for 2 hours straight and maybe take a 15 minute break. This strategy could be better but I first need to slowly get into a habit of trying alternative time management methods.

The ideas I want to incorporate is to get into habit of meditating for at least 5 minutes a day; I have already found an app for my phone on this.The other idea I want to start using is the time box method which I can incorporate by setting a timer that will signal when I need to stop and reflect. Eventually, I expect this to method to become a habit and I won't need the timer.

My overall plan for time management in phase 0 is to have a few trial sessions using the different methods and consolidating the ones that works for me. To continue to grow and become more productive I will need to research new ideas to try and learn from the failed attempts.


# 1.2 The Command Line

The shell is a command line based interpreter that provides communication with the operating system. The bash is one type of shell used to communicate with the Unix OS.

The one challenge I had going through the material was getting the grep command to work during the example in the Command Line Crash Course. I researched online but did not find the solution so I have marked it to come back to. I also had a little trouble with using cat command to write to a file and then closing it as the CTRL-d escape did not work but later found for me it was pressing CTRL+d.

I was able to use all the commands, even the grep but the example that was shown for grep did not work.

The most important commands I would have to say for the beginner like me would be the navigation command pwd, ls,  and cd. Navigating to get to where you want to go and searching for the files you are seeking is important because you cannot use the other commands without first finding the files you need.

pwd - process work directory - shows you the current file path to the work directory you are in

ls - list - this list all the files

mv - move or rename a file - this will move a file or rename it

cd - change directory - this will change which directory you are in

../ - previous directory - I believe this one goes to the previous directory

touch - create a file - this will create a new empty file

mkdir - make directory - will make a new directory

less - display file - this will parse and display the file in increments and allow you to scroll up and down

rmdir - remove directory - this will remove a directory

rm - remove - this is used to remove files

help - help - I think this one will pull up help manual - just tested this and wow its a built in cheat-sheet!


# 1.4 Create, Fork, and Cloning

Ok so to create a new repo, fork it and clone a repo on GitHub you would first sign in. On the top right hand part of the toolbar there is a "+" sign click on that and click "New Repository". Next, give your repository a name, set it to public, give it a license(MIT will do) and hit create repository.

To fork or copy a repository we would find the repository that we want to copy into our own personal GitHub and find the little icon shaped like "Y Fork" and click on that. Then select your profile and it will automatically take you back to your new copied repository.

Last, to clone a repo from your own GitHub navigate into the repo you would like to clone and copy the URL in the bottom right under "HTTPS clone URL". Go into your terminal and using pwd/cd navigate to a folder you would like to clone the repository into. Once there type in "git clone URL" where URL is the HTTPS address you copied and hit enter. One finished you can hit "ls" to see if the files indeed transfer.

You would fork a repository vs creating a new one for several reasons but a main one is that you would be copying the latest version of the project to work off of. Plus you would be able to work without affecting the original project. It also allows for code review (pull request) where the original author could review and add in your code to the original project if he/she likes it.

I wouldn't say I had any struggles technically when setting up git or GitHub but I did feel nervous and took things slowly as this is a new environment I have never used before. Overall during the whole process I finally had a better understanding on what GitHub was for and learned about repositories and how to copy them and work with them locally on your computer/personal GitHub. As for Git I understand that using this program will be an essential part in managing code and using it for the first time to clone a repository gave me some confidence against my fears on learning Git & GitHub.
