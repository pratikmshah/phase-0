# 1.6 My Website Reflection

Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- First, to create a new repository click on the "+" sign on the top right of your GitHub bar and select "New repository"
- Second, give your repository a name, description, select public/private, add a license, and hit create repository
- Next, click on your new repository and on the bottom right copy the HTTPS clone URL. Open your command line
- Last, find the folder path you want to copy the file in and type "git clone URL". Where URL is the copied link and hit enter.

Describe what open source means.
- Open source is the practice of sharing not only the software but the source code as well and allowing anyone to contribute and alter the code as they see fit with some or no restrictions at all.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Open source has its pros and cons but for the most part I like it as it allows for a software to be provided with a workhorse of developers who want to utilize their skills to help the project grow. It also helps a lot people that want to build programs but may not have enough money to buy licenses for IDE (integrated development environment), graphics softwares, etc... Open source doesn't make me nervous but does make me a little protective if I had a software company and someone comes along and developes a very identical version of my software and open sources it that could devestate the company; but then again it provides competetion look at Git and Bitkeeper. I'm sure it feels like a utopia for all the developers who participate in open source but to me it doesn't feel that big and the reason is because I am not part of any of these open source community yet.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
- Licenses help improve the distribution of the software and gives everyone who uses it an explanation of what they can and cannot do with it. Otherwise, if you didn't have a license you would have to compose an agreement to each individual person who would like to use your code.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- This challenge definitely helped me solidify somewhat of a process flow on how to use create a new branch, commit and merge back to the source. It definitely was an aha moment once I figured out the what the whole process was doing as basically the idea was never to work from the orgin always work on a branch and then merge it back to the origin. At first I had to keep using the guide and double checking myself when branching out and doing pull request/merging but I was able to get the hang of it and now slowley am moving away from having to look at the guide.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
- I watched a lot of videos on Git and Github and the one I found that helped me was this 50min webinar that explained both from installation all the way to creating a repository and merging changes on GitHub
