#3.4 Chrome Dev Tools

**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**
- The dev tools help a lot to help out with formatting and positioning because you are not only able to change around element value live and without messing with the original code but you are also able to add elements in real time. It helps a lot to speed up process of trial and error

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**
- You are able to resize elements using the DOM in a couple of ways. One way its to directly alter the height and width values using pixels(px), percentages(%), and other units such as relative font size (em). You can also edit these numbers in the box model as well as the object's margin, padding, border and position.


**What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**
- I find absolute positioning the easiest because it doesn't collapse to any margins around it and you can basically place the object anywhere on the page. There is a lot of other factors to think about when using the other positions and it could make writing the layout a little more time consuming.

The differences between the four positions are listed below:
- Absolute - does not leave spaces for other elements and can collapse on other margins
- Fixed - does not leave spaces for other elements and will not move when scrolling through the page
- Static - uses its current position in the flow
- Relative - will leave a gap between elements related to the element's position

**What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?**
- Margin is the outside part of the element and it is mainly how much space you want between the object and other elements
- Border is the part between the margin and padding and it surrounds the content.
- Padding is the inside part and is the distance between the content and border.


**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**
- I liked it for the most part as this was new to me it took some time to get the hang of manipulating the DOM and how values would alter the page. The box model is an important concept to learn in web development and using the DOM to assist in manipulation of objects is crucial, in my opinion.
