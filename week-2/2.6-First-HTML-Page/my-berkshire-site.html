<!--

- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  I would have to say I was a little intimidated about translating an actual site into html despite html being very simple and straight forward but it felt pretty great that my partner and I were able to read the site and be like "ah ha!" this is probably what they used; like reverse engineering

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  It was pretty easy to find what we were looking for as there is a vast amount of information online about HTML5. The hard part I would say was figuring out the correct keywords to use to get good results. For example adding the copywright symbol.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  It was easy as my partner and I talked in the beginning and said let us just get the words on the page and forget any formatting. We later went back and adjusted some of the tags such as <h1> for the company name. But for the most part we kept strickly to creating a skeleton of the site.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  In my opinion I think the good part about html is that it is very simple and straightforward; you can link and image or create in image in just a line or two. The bad part of html is that the code gets really clustered and lengthy which can make it tough for revisions and to spot where formatting errors may occur. Imaging thousands of lines of html!


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  Besides the cheatsheet on my desk I'd have to say its similar to an email. When you write an email everything goes inside of one box/window so this is the <html> tag and then you select your receiptants and subject which would make this the <title>. Last, you do all of your work inside the body of the email and well look at that you do all of your work inside of the <body> tags in html. So remember writing a letter/email structure.
