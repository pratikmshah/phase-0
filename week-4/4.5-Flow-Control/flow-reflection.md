#4.5 Flow Control

What is the most important thing to know about flow control in your opinion?
- In my opinion the most important thing to know about flow control is to be careful about how the protocol is used for each flow control operator. For example, you write if statements for every condition but this wouldn't be efficient vs pairing the if with elses. Also for loops you must make sure that when you assign your conditional statement it does not enter an infinite loop and stops when you want it to.

What is the most difficult thing to understand about flow control?
- The loops I would say had to be a difficult to understand as there are quite a few and each have their or protocols on what parameters they need. In addition, you must also make sure your conditionals are correct so they loop as you expect them to.


What are some ways of comparing two objects to see if they are the same?
- There are a couple of efficient and inefficiency ways to to compare to operators. The most efficient way to compare objects is to use the == operator. Another, inefficiency way you could check to see if objects are alike is to use a combination of if else statement and the != to operator. So, if the objects are not equal do something else it is equal.


Which challenge was the most difficult? Why do you think that was?
- The most difficult problem in this challenge was the detecting leap years as when I was working with my partner we found it was a bunch of nested if else statements in order to get the solution. We had to start over because we nested the statements incorrectly so you have to watch out and be careful about starting and closing if else statements.


What did your pair teach you about Ruby, flow control, programming, or being a good pair when you were pairing?
- It was good pairing up with someone as when we were working on the leap years challenge she taught me how to be careful with your opening and closing if/else statements. She also suggested we us coderpad which was a great idea so that both of us could get a hands on apporach.
