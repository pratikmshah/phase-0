What is an integer? What is a float?
- Intgers are numbers with no decimal places so -1, 0, 1 and so forth. Floats contain a decimal even if it is even it will still consist of a .0.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
- The difference between a float and integer division is simply an integer ignores remainders while floats displays remainders. For instance if I had wanted to buy a game for $50 and only had $45 I can't buy 90% of the game. This is where integer division comes in handy and in this case it will result in 0. For float, lets say I had 10 pieces of candy and three people (including me) to split it with. I will evenly be able to split 3 pieces per person while the last piece being broken up into thirds. So in total each person could have 3.33 pieces of candy (not the best example but you get the idea).
